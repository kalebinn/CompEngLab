### P1 - Square Wave Generator
**P1_Completed.asm** - Code to generate square wave from PIC microcontroller. LED (D5) blinks at the same rate.  
It is easy to modify: 
- Duty Cycle (TIMEHIGHCNT, TIMELOWCNT)
- Half period (BIGNUM)
**Output Data** Contains output images of the square wave from the oscilloscope.
